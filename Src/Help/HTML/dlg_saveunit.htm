    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is displayed when the <em>File | Save Unit</em> menu
      option is clicked. It is used to specify the file name, file type and
      formatting information for the unit that is to be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      All currently selected snippets, with the exception of any
      <a href="snippet_freeform.htm">freeform</a> snippets, are included in the
      generated unit. (See the <a href="task_search.htm">Search Database</a>
      task for information on how to select the required snippets).
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue is a standard Windows save dialogue box with a few added
      options.
    </p>
    <p>
      You specify the name and folder for the file where the unit will be saved
      in in the usual way. <strong class="warning">Warning:</strong> the chosen file name, minus its extension
      must be a valid Pascal unit name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the <em>Save as type</em> drop down list to specify the type of file
      to be saved. Options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A Pascal unit file (.pas) &ndash; The code is written to a file with
        extension .pas. The unit is given a name based on the file name.
      </li>
      <li>
        A plain text file (.txt) &ndash; This is the same as the Pascal unit
        file except that the extension is .txt rather than .pas.
      </li>
      <li>
        A HTML 5 file (.html) &ndash; This option writes the source code out as a
        valid HTML 5 document that uses embedded CSS to format the code. The
        source code will be syntax highlighted if the <em>Use syntax
        highlighting</em> check box is checked.
      </li>
      <li>
        An XHTML file (.html) &ndash; This option writes the source code out as a
        valid XHTML document that uses embedded CSS to format the code. The
        source code will be syntax highlighted if the <em>Use syntax
        highlighting</em> check box is checked.
      </li>
      <li>
        A rich text file (.rtf) &ndash; The source code is written out as an RTF
        document. Again syntax highlighting can be used if the <em>Use syntax
        highlighting</em> check box is checked.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each snippet's description can be written as a Pascal comment to the
      output file. Use the <em>Comment style</em> drop down list to specify the
      style of commenting to be used. Such comments can be inhibited by
      selecting the <em>No descriptive comments</em> option from the list. If
      the <em>Truncate comments to 1st paragraph</em> check box is ticked then
      only the first paragraph of each snippet's description is used. Clearing
      this check box means that the full text of snippet descriptions are used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output file encoding can be be specified in the <em>File Encoding</em>
      drop down list. Options vary depending on the file type. Some file types
      support only a single encoding, in which case the drop down list will be
      disabled. The encodings are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>ANSI Code Page <code>nnn</code></em> &ndash; ANSI encoding for the system default code page,
        where <code>nnn</code> is the code page for the user's locale.
        Available for both plain text and Pascal unit files.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>UTF-8</em> &ndash; UTF-8 encoding, with BOM<sup>&dagger;</sup>.
        Available for both plain text and Pascal unit files and as the only
        option for HTML 5 and XHTML files. If used for Pascal units be warned that the
        unit will only compile with compilers that support Unicode source
        files.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>UTF-16 Little Endian</em> &ndash; UTF-16 LE encoding, with
        BOM<sup>&dagger;</sup>. Available for plain text files only.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>UTF-18 Big Endian</em> &ndash; UTF-16 BE encoding, with
        BOM<sup>&dagger;</sup>. Available for plain text files only.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>ASCII</em> &ndash; ASCII encoding. Available as the only option for
        rich text files.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The output can be previewed by clicking the <em>Preview</em> button. This
      displays the source code in a dialogue box, formatted according to your
      selections. Text in the preview can be selected and copied to the
      clipboard if required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the <em>Save</em> button to write the unit to disk or <em>Cancel</em>
      to abort.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Footnote
    </h3>
    <p>
      &dagger; BOM = Byte Order Mark or Preamble: a sequence of bytes at the
      start of a text file that identifies its encoding.
