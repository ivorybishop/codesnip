    </h1>
    <p>
        This dialogue box is displayed when the <em>File | Save Snippet
        Information</em> menu option is clicked. It is used to specify the file
        name, file type and encoding information for the snippet information 
        that is to be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dialogue is a standard Windows save dialogue box with a few added
        options.
    </p>
    <p>
        You specify the name and folder for the file where the snippet information
        is to be written in in the usual way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the <em>Save as type</em> drop down list to specify the type of file
        to be saved. Options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plain text.</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>XHTML</li>
        <li>Rich text format</li>
        <li>Markdown</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The HTML 5 and XHTML options are very similar and differ only in the
        type of HTML that is written. For either type an embedded CSS style
        sheet is used to style the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        When any of the HTML 5, XHTML or rich text file types are selected source
        code embedded in the snippet information will be syntax highlighted if
        the <em>Use syntax highlighting</em> check box is checked.
    </p>
    <p>
        The output file encoding can be be specified in the <em>File Encoding</em>
        drop down list. Options vary depending on the file type. Some file types
        support only a single encoding. The encodings are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <em>ANSI Code Page <code>nnn</code></em> &ndash; ANSI encoding for the system default code page,
            where <code>nnn</code> is the code page for the user's locale.
            Available as an option for plain text and Markdown file formats.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>UTF-8</em> &ndash; UTF-8 encoding, with BOM<sup>&dagger;</sup>.
            Available as an option for plain text and Markdown file formats and
            as the only encoding available for HTML 5 and XHTML file formats.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>UTF-16 Little Endian</em> &ndash; UTF-16 LE encoding, with
            BOM<sup>&dagger;</sup>. Available as an option for plain text and Markdown file formats.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>UTF-18 Big Endian</em> &ndash; UTF-16 BE encoding, with
            BOM<sup>&dagger;</sup>. Available as an option for plain text and Markdown file formats.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>ASCII</em> &ndash; The only encoding available for the rich text file.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The output can be previewed by clicking the <em>Preview</em> button. This
        displays the snippet information in a dialogue box, formatted according to your
        selections. Text in the preview can be selected and copied to the
        clipboard if required.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the <em>Save</em> button to write the snippet information to disk or choose
        <em>Cancel</em> to abort.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong class="warning">Warning:</strong> When plain text or Markdown formatted
        snippet information is written in ANSI format it is possibe that the information
        contains characters that can't be represented in the system default ANSI encoding.
        If this happens a warning
        dialogue box is displayed whenever the snippet information is written to file
        or is previewed.
    </p>

        &dagger; BOM = Byte Order Mark or Preamble: a sequence of bytes at the
        start of a text file that identifies its encoding.
